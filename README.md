Algorithms using C#
Problems are as follows:
1. PlusMinus: Given an array of integers, calculate which fraction of its elements are positive, which fraction of its elements are negative, and which fraction of its elements are zeroes, respectively. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.
2. DiagonalDifference:Given a square matrix of size, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.
3. Min-MaxSum: Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
